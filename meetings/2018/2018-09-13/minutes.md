  meeting.

* Chair Jerdonek said he created the project information page (suggested by

  Member Wasserman suggested including documents regarding the budget. Chair
  Jerdonek will look into that. This page should be linked to the TAC
  recommendations. Older documents such as the Dominion contracts could be
  included.

* Chair Jerdonek said TAC's report to the Commission has been sent to
  the Commission.

Public comment: none.


**5\. Member Reports**

Chair Jerdonek referred to the documents in the packet. The Project Manager
job description has already been posted on the City’s job site. Regarding the
description Member Wasserman said it would be good to have Microsoft project
management experience.

The discussion revolved around whether the requirements were too much overall
or too slanted in some direction (e.g. technology or election process). It
was decided that the Committee should write a statement in regards to the job
description that lays out its position on what most relevant experience and
skills the candidate should have. Member Wasserman will draft it and Chair
Jerdonek will finalize and send to the Commission. Member Hage so moved,
Chair Jerdonek seconded. Upon voice vote, the motion carried, 3-0.

Chair Jerdonek referred to the documents regarding Los Angeles County's
voting system project. He made a public records request for the source code
and received a reply that the code was exempt from disclosure. It is
apparently not open source, nor even disclosed, so the press release about it
being open source is false. Member Hage stated that software subject to
public scrutiny carries less risk of hacking than closed source software.

The Committee was concerned that LA County's representation of open source
would mislead others into erroneous opinions about open source. Member
Wasserman volunteered to contact people in the Software Conservancy, OSI, and
the Free Software Foundation to let them know about that, and to let them
take the lead in clarifying things.

Public comment:

Mr. Ben Burkert commented that it seemed odd that LA County’s project is
called open source, since it doesn’t pass muster. They should provide the
license for it.

On the matter of the election activities observation, Chair Jerdonek asked if
the Committee wanted to do any of them as a committee or individually. It was
decided that Chair Jerdonek will try to set up an appointment to do an
observation on Thursday, October 11, and then have the committee meeting
after.

There was a short discussion about the document Member Kattouw provided
regarding San Mateo's election processes. Member Wasserman also reported on
his speaking engagement at Santa Clara County Citizens Advisory Committee on
Elections (CACE). It was sparsely attended and there didn’t seem to be much
excitement about the San Francisco project. No significant questions were
raised.


**6\. Voting System Component Development**

Chair Jerdonek reported that he added to TAC's sample data repository the one
hundred or so PDF scans of ballots received from the Department. He asked if
Member Hage could do an inventory of the types. Member Hage said he is having
some problems with the scans due to inconsistency in their
resolution/sharpness.

On the question of the City and County having copyright ownership of TAC's
work, Chair Jerdonek said the Deputy City Attorney advised that technically
the City and County should probably have copyright, but that it probably
won't be an issue. It is something that TAC could do at a later date.

Member Hage asked how the sample data should be organized, e.g. doing it by
date at the top level and adding subdirectories if there are more counties.
He will do a subdirectory for each of the June and November elections. There
was a question of SHA files data and whether the Department had any.

Public comment:

Mr. Ben Burkert said he has had experience with such a copyright issue, and
it is a pain. Maybe set up a contributor’s license agreement (CLA).


**7\. Committee Recommendations**

No discussion.


**8\. Topics for future discussion**

It was suggested to revisit the CLA topic.

Public comment:

Mr. Jim Soper mentioned that he met with Gavin Newsom. He seemed to be aware
of the project but didn’t know that the funding effort did not make it into
the State budget. He was asked to send Newsom a memo regarding this.


**Adjourned at 7:47 p.m.**
