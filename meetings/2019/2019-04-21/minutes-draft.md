**Order of Business**

**1\. Call to Order & Roll Call**

Chair Jerdonek called the meeting to order at 3:12 p.m. Present: Members
Hage, Jerdonek, Kattouw. (Member attendance at this special working meeting
had previously been announced as optional.)


**2\. General Public Comment**

Brent Turner of the California Association of Voting Officials said he hoped
that appropriate attention would be paid towards the database and election
management system (EMS), as well as the Dechert design, both of which should
incorporate GPLv3. He said that a national security crisis is occurring and
that OSVTAC must keep a watchful eye. He commended San Francisco for the
work being done.


**3\. Voting System Component Development**

The committee members began by reporting on the open source results reporter
(ORR) work they completed since the last meeting.

The members spent the remainder of the meeting working on ORR and improving
the output of the ORR demo page, which is viewable at:
<https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-demo>

Specifically, Member Hage worked on completing the addition of a "winning
status" to each contest and also on the addition of turnout data.

Member Kattouw worked on improving the formatting of the tables, including
things like standardizing the alignment of numbers within cells and fixing
the position of the header row for the precinct data table when scrolling the
browser window vertically.

Chair Jerdonek worked on finishing the table of contents for the results
summary page.

Public comment: None.


**Adjourned at 5:48 p.m.**
