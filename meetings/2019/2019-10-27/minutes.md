**Order of Business**

Chair Jerdonek called the meeting to order at 3:05 p.m. Present: Members
Hage, Jerdonek, Kattouw. (Member attendance at this special working meeting

**2\. General Public Comment**

None.


**3\. Voting System Component Development**

During this item the committee members worked on the committee's [open source
election results reporter
(ORR)](https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-reporter) and improving the
output for the ORR demo pages. The demo pages can be viewed here:
<https://osvtac.github.io/osv-results-demo/>

Member Hage worked on getting the data converter ready for San Francisco's
upcoming November 5, 2019 election, which includes getting a zero report
published to the demo site prior to Election Day.

Member Kattouw worked on improving the results display for pass/fail contests
like state propositions and local measures. For example, he worked on
incorporating the approval threshold and putting a red check mark next
to "No" if the measure or proposition didn't pass.

Chair Jerdonek worked on making the GitHub repository for the demo site
automatically build the results pages and publish the updated version to
the website whenever new commits are pushed to the repository
([issue #5](https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-demo/issues/5) in the
repository's issue tracker).

Public comment: None.

**Adjourned at 5:48 p.m.**
