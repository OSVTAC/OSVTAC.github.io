**3\. Voting System Component Development**

During this item the committee members worked on the committee's [open source
election results reporter
(ORR)](https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-reporter) and improving the
output of the ORR demo page. The demo page is viewable at:
<https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-demo>

Member Hage worked on adding new attributes to the JSON input file and data
model (e.g. `contest.approval_required`, `contest.name`, etc), as listed in
ORR's [issue #16](https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-reporter/issues/16) .

Member Kattouw worked on improving the display of the RCV results (e.g.
first-round totals).

Chair Jerdonek worked on replacing the `generate.sh` shell scripts used to
generate the demo pages with a single `generate.py` Python script.

Public comment: None.
