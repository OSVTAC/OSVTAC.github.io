<https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-demo>

Member Hage worked on updating the contest-status loaders to include turnout
with the results.

Member Kattouw worked on a number of improvements to the display (e.g. fixing
the nesting of list items, using bigger headers, hiding the 50% cutoff line
when it displays outside of their table, etc).

`orr` script.
