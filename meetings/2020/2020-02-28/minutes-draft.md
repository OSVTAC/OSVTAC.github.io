Hage, Jerdonek, Kattouw. (Member attendance at this special working meeting

**3\. Voting System Component Development**

During this item the committee members worked on the committee's [open source
election results reporter
(ORR)](https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-reporter) and improving the
output for the ORR demo pages. The demo pages can be viewed here:
<https://osvtac.github.io/osv-results-demo/>

Member Hage worked on things like--

* getting breakdowns of the voter registration totals by Election Day and
  vote-by-mail,
* processing additional ballot statistics like ballots rejected, and
* exposing links to the statewide totals for statewide contests.

Member Kattouw worked on some UI improvements like--

* fixing a bug in the detection of the "Yes" option,
* making the colors of the green and red check marks match,
* improving the appearance of the language selector,
* improving the "back to summary page" link, and
* improving the display of write-in candidates.

Member Kattouw also worked on getting ORR to successfully build the
March 2020 data (i.e. the zero report data), as well as getting the party
data loaded and displayed.

Chair Jerdonek worked on multi-language support for phrases within the
template, including adding support for phrases that involve variables
like "N of M Precincts Reporting" (aka "format strings").

Public comment: None.

**Adjourned at 4:46 p.m.**
