To provide comments on the committee's recommendations, you can email your
feedback to the committee. Contact information can be found on the [About
page][osvtac-about].

Alternatively, if you have a [GitHub][github] account, you can view the
repository for the recommendations [here][recommendations-repo] and make a
comment by opening an issue on the [issue tracker][recommendations-issues].
To suggest specific wording for some portion of the document, you can open a
"pull request" [here][recommendations-pulls].

The committee may discuss and/or vote on your suggestions at a future
meeting. Note that because of San Francisco's [Sunshine Ordinance] and other
open government laws, the committee is limited in how it can collaborate
outside of meetings on committee matters. Committee members are able to see
and read your comments and suggestions, but they cannot necessarily respond
publicly as individuals.
