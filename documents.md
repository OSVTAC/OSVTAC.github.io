You can see a history of all changes [here][recommendations-history].

To provide comments on the committee's recommendations, you can email your
feedback to the committee. Contact information can be found on the [About
page][osvtac-about].

Alternatively, if you have a [GitHub][github] account and are familiar with
[Markdown], you can view the [GitHub repository][recommendations-repo] for
the recommendations and follow the instructions in the README file for
providing feedback.

The committee may discuss and/or vote on your suggestions at a future
meeting. Note that because of San Francisco's [Sunshine Ordinance] and other
open government laws, the committee is limited in how it can collaborate
outside of meetings on committee matters. Committee members are able to see
and read your comments and suggestions, but they cannot necessarily respond
publicly as individuals.
