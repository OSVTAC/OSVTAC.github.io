# Contributor License Agreement

OSVTAC welcomes your contributions to our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/OSVTAC)! In particular, you can contribute to:
- Our [recommendations document](https://github.com/OSVTAC/project-recommendations)
- Our [results reporter](https://github.com/OSVTAC/osv-results-reporter) application (`orr`)
- [This website](https://github.com/OSVTAC/OSVTAC.github.io)

Before we can accept your contributions, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You're free to submit pull requests before signing the CLA, but they will not be merged until we receive a signed CLA from you.

## How to sign the CLA
- Print the agreement ([PDF](files/documents/cla-agreement.pdf), [Markdown](files/documents/cla-agreement.md))
- Fill out your name and address under "You" near the bottom, and sign on the signature line
- Scan the signed document
- Email this scan to elections.commission@sfgov.org with the subject line _"OSVTAC CLA"_

## Contributions containing work by third parties
If you submit a pull request that contains contributions not authored by you (for example, code that you copied from somewhere else), explicitly state this in your commit summary. Specify which parts of your commit came from somewhere else, where they came from (a URL is preferred), and under what license they are published. The license of the third-party work must be [compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility) with the license of the project you're adding it to.
